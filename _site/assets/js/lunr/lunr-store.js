        "excerpt":"This article describes how a DNS query gets resolved. Though a website is loaded in just one-click on our devices, a lot of work goes on at the back end to render that webpage. Let’s see how it’s done.   Before you read further, these are the terms you need to get acquainted with:  Important Terms:   IP Address   An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.   Query   A query is a message sent by the client to the server.   Cache   Computing component that transparently stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.   DNS - the Internet’s Directory Service   The browser needs to translate “www.blogger.com” to its corresponding IP address, because hostnames can consist of variable-length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers. For these reasons, hosts are also identified by so-called IP addresses.   DNS Resolver   Servers designed to receive DNS queries from web browsers and other applications.   Authoritative Name Servers   Servers where the DNS records are stored. Consists of root name servers, TLD servers and authoritative servers.      Interaction of DNS Servers:     Consider you click on the URL www.blogger.com           Browser first checks if IP address is present in its DNS cache, if not it calls the function present in the operating system to do DNS lookups. For E.g. on Linux that function is getaddrinfo.            The OS might also have a DNS cache, if it has, then the function first checks if IP address is present in this cache. If IP is still not found, the function sends request to a server called DNS resolver            The resolver checks if IP address is present in its cache, if not it contacts the root name server.            The root name server checks if IP is present in its cache, if yes, it sends the corresponding IP address, if not it replies with “I don’t know this name but ask the TLD server.”            The resolver then asks/queries the TLD server.            The TLD server checks if IP is present in its cache, if yes, it sends the corresponding IP address, if not it replies with “I don’t know this name but ask the Authoritative name server.”            The resolver then queries the authoritative name server.            The authoritative name server has the IP Address of the requested website in its database. It responds with the corresponding IP to the resolver.            The resolver/local DNS server then sends this IP to the OS.            This IP is communicated to the browser and it starts opening a TCP connection to the server.       As shown above, the DNS query is iterative in nature, as recursive queries put heavy load of name resolution in upper levels of hierarchy.

        "title": "Creating Processes",
        "excerpt":"In this article I have tried to explain the important things that happen during a process creation. I always had doubts about     How a process is created in OS ?   From where does it all start ?   What happens when you start a process ?   What exactly is fork and exec ?   Let us see.   Process Heirarchy   Every process in Linux lives in a “process tree”. You can see that tree by running pstree in terminal. The root of the tree is init, with PID 1. Every process (except init) has a parent, and any process has many children.   Fork() System Call   The fork() system call is used to create a new process.The new process created by fork is called the child process.This function is called once but returns twice. The only difference in the returns is that the return value in the child is 0, whereas the return value in the parent is the process ID of the new child.The child - the process that is created is an (almost) exact copy of the calling process.   Exec() System Call  (Load into memory and then execute)   Fork creates a new process which is a clone of itself, but what if we want to change the course of the process? Then we use exec() syscall. Exec() replaces the current process — its text, data, heap, and stack segments — with a brand-new program from disk.   On Boot Up   On boot the kernel starts the init process, which then forks and execs the systems boot scripts. These fork and exec more programs, eventually ending up forking a login process.This is also known as process spawning which is carried out by these two systemcalls [fork &amp; exec] in the background.     Example code snippet of fork() and exec() in a C program:   int pid = fork(); // now I am split in two! aaaaugh! // who am I? I could be either the child or the parent if (pid == 0) {     // ok I am the child process     // ls will take over and I will be a totally different process      exec([\"ls\"]) } else if (pid == -1) {     // omg fork failed -- this is a disaster :( } else {     // ok i am the parent     // continue my business being a cool program     // I could wait for the child to finish if I want }    Now, if I want to start a process called ls to list all the files in a directory. The process starts out like this:   my parent      |- me   When I run fork(), a child is created which is a clone of myself.   my parent      |- me           |-- clone of me  Then my clone calls exec() that is, my child runs exec(\"ls\"). That leaves us with   my parent      |- me           |-- ls  Once ls exits I will be all alone by myself.(Almost)   my parent      |- me           |-- ls(zombie)  At this point ls is actually a zombie process! That means it’s dead, but it’s waiting around for the parent in case the parent wants to check on its (child’s) return value (using the wait system call.) Once I get its return value, I will really be all alone again.   my parent      |- me     The following paragraph from Operating Systems:Three Easy Pieces sums up the gist of the article:      The fork() system call is strange; its partner in crime, exec(), is not so normal either. What it does: given the name of an executable (e.g., wc), and some arguments (e.g., p3.c), it loads code (and static data) from that executable and overwrites its current code segment (and current static data) with it; the heap and stack and other parts of the memory space of the program are re-initialized. Then the OS simply runs that program, passing in any arguments as the argv of that process. Thus, it does not create a new process; rather, it transforms the currently running program (formerly p3) into a different running program (wc). After the exec() in the child, it is almost as if p3.c never ran; a successful call to exec() never returns.      References:   Remzi H.

        "excerpt":"Errors and bugs are a necessary evil in any software developement field, and learning the art of debugging is a very vital step if you want to:      Improve your developer productivity   Write reliable code   In this article I have tried to document all the debugging methods that I learnt while working on my projects.      Whenever you encounter a bug in any of your code/installation it is always helpful to remember the following things:     The error happens for a logical reason - its never magic   Be confident that you can fix it   Being stuck is temporary   Now that you have these 3 things in your toolkit let us proceed for some debugging steps so that you can feel your inherent superpower. :)   Step 1: Read error message carefully   Error messages usually contain a lot of information about what went wrong. But they sometimes can be very large and overwhelming to read. You can  use these tricks to extract the necessary information from them:     Start fixing the first error message in case of multiple error messages. Fixing the first one often fixes the remaining errors   Search if any solution is available on the internet for the error   Step 2: Brainstorm possible reasons for the error   Now here I won’t be able to give exact reasons but some examples may include:     Is there something wrong with the server?   Am I using correct package version?   Have I followed all the instructions?(In case of errors in installations)   After finding possible reasons try to narrow it down to the most possible reason, also draw a diagram of the process if possible   Step 3: Investigate      Read the documentation (Important)   Add lots of print statements   Use a debugger   Look at logs   A meme that highlights the importance of reading the docs:      Step 4: Make complex things simple      Fix one problem at a time   Write clean code   Reduce randomness   Shorten your feedback/output loop (when you need to run the code many times)   Step 5: This also helps      Take a break   Ask a friend   Explain the error/bug out loud   Finding tools that make debugging easier - eg. debuggers, profilers, tracers, fuzzers, etc   Step 6: After fixing the bug     Celebrate - dance a little   Tell somebody what you learnt - that way you won’t forget it   Document your bug    Debugging can be an interesting adventure.   I would like to end this article by quoting Edsger Dijkstra:     ” Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence! “   ","categories": ["tech-insights"],

        "title": "The TCP/IP Model and Security",
        "excerpt":"The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) reference model defines how information moves from sender to receiver. TCP/IP was not originally designed with security, so we must secure the network using many external methods.  Many protocols are designed to secure network traffic at various levels. The choice of where to implement security in the stack depends on the application’s and user’s requirements. Regardless of where security is applied in the stack, it must provide the following fundamental services to the user:     Key management   Confidentiality   Nonrepudiation   Integrity / Authentication   Authorization   The security measures implemented at different layers of the stack can offer varying services. In some instances, it is beneficial to assign certain capabilities to one layer while allocating others to a different layer. This blog explores the benefits and nuances of providing security at various levels within the TCP/IP stack.      Security at the Application Layer  The application layer connects applications to the underlying network for message transmission. Host-to-host communication occurs at the application layer, so security has to be implemented in end hosts. Applications should design their security mechanisms when their specific needs cannot be met by the lower layers. One example of this is non-repudiation. The lower layers struggle to provide non-repudiation services because they do not have access to the data. Some examples of the security mechanisms implemented at the applicaion layer include PGP, Kerberos, and Secure Shell.  Benefits     Executing in the context of the user enables easy access to user credentials such as private keys.   Ensures complete access to the data the user aims to protect, making it easier to offer services like non-repudiation.   An application can be extended without relying on the operating system to provide these services.   Key Considerations     Security mechanisms have to be designed independently for each application, so there is a greater probability of making mistakes and hence opening up security holes for attacks.   Security at the Transport Layer  The transport layer is responsible for logical communications between applications running on different hosts. Adding security at the transport layer does not need enhancements in each application. TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol is implemented in the transport layer which provides security services such as authentication, integrity, and confidentiality on top of TCP. (TLS is not implemented over UDP as it needs to maintain context for a connection)  Benefits     It bundles authentication with encryption.   Easy to install and execute.   It reinforces the integrity of the communication.   The TLS protocol allows client and server applications to detect message tampering, message interception and message forgery.   Key Considerations     Obtaining the user context is complicated.   TLS can only be implemented on an end system.   Applications need modification to request security services from the transport layer.   Security at the Network Layer  The network layer is concerned with addressing and routing packets from the source to the destination. It is the lowest layer in the OSI model that deals with end-to-end transmission. Implementing security at this layer has many advantages.  Benefits     Decreased overheads of key negotiations.   If security implemented at the network and lower levels, fewer applications need changes.   Ability to build VPNs and intranets which are subnet based, and network layer supports subnet-based security.   IPSec, the protocol that can secure all and any kind of Internet traffic operates at the network level. IPSec also allows per flow or per connection security and thus allows for very fine-grained security control.     Key Considerations       Difficulty in handling issues such as non - repudiation of data. [As discussed above, this is better handled in higher layers]   Difficult to exercise control on a per user basis on a multiuser machine when security is implemented at network layer.   Security at the Link Layer  The Data Link layer is responsible for communications between end-device network interface cards. This layer encapsulates network packets into frames and also performs error detection. If a dedicated link between two hosts or routers is present, then traffic needs encryption to prevent snooping, here hardware encryption devices can be used. For devices connected to IP networks, security at the data link layer is insufficient; one must move up a layer to provide adequate security services.  Benefits     Speedy and fast to implement because of hardware encryption devices   Key Considerations     Not scalable   This works well only on dedicated links – for e.g. ATM machines   The two entities involved in communication have to be physically connected.

        "title": "Node Js and React Js Web App: An Overview",
        "excerpt":"During my summer internship, I was tasked with building a full-stack web application to meet the company’s needs. The technology was completely new to me, so it took quite a bit of time to understand how the different components—Node.js for the backend, React for the frontend, and a database—fit together. In this blog, I will explain the general structure of a Node-React full-stack application wrt programming perspective.      ℹ️ Note:  This is a beginner’s guide, and the structure outlined here will be used in the development environment.  To deploy the application to production, several changes need to be made, including modifications to the backend .env file and converting the React frontend to static JavaScript files. I plan to cover more details on this in my upcoming blogs.     Components of a Full Stack Web App     Frontend Development            It is the visible part of a website responsible for user experience.       Responsible for user interaction.       Calls the backend api.           Backend Development            It involves the server-side development of websites, focusing primarily on their functionality.       Responsible for managing the database through queries and APIs based on client-side commands.           Database            An organized collection of related data that enables efficient retrieval, insertion, and deletion of information.               As shown in the picture, this illustrates the flow of a query from the frontend to the backend and to the database, then back.   Points to Note     It is considered best practice to separate the client-side frontend code from the server-side backend code by organizing them into distinct folders.   If you are using a Node-React technology stack, it’s important to note that the backend routes and frontend routes are different.   During the development of your web application, you will need to run the React development server on a specific port, such as 3000, while the Node server should be started on a different port, like 5000. This setup allows the front end to send requests to the appropriate REST API (back-end route) to perform functions or fetch data. (PS: in the PROD environment, the frontend and the backend are bundled up to use a single port)   If you are using MySQL or a similar relational database, the Node.js server will typically query the data on the default port 3306. However, if you wish to change this default port, you can specify the new port in the environment variables. (More details on this will be covered in a future blog post.)   The ports really confused me in the beginning, but once the WHY and HOW of things is clear, everything becomes a piece of cake. This was a brief overview of the structure of a full stack application. I plan to write more blogs about this particular setup, so stay tuned! 😊  ","categories": ["full-stack"],
