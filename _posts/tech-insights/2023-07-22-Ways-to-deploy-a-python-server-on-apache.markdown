Recently I programmed a TLS/SSL checker web app - which checks which tls protocol a website is using and also gives a list of SSL vulnerablities the website is prone to.
I programmed this script in python using flask framework and now I wanted to deploy it to the server.
But little did I know that deploying or setting up a python server with flask can be tricky especially on a apache server.

So, these are my learnings and some useful links - you can read them so that you can finish deploying a python server on Windows apache faster than me ! :)


## Prerequisites:
* Python - can be downloaded from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Flask - can be installed by typing the following command in cmd 
`pip install flask`
* WfastCGI module - installed by typing the following command in cmd `pip install wfastcgi`

## **Deploying using Windows IIS Server:**

1. I have used this [link](https://medium.com/@dpralay07/deploy-a-python-flask-application-in-iis-server-and-run-on-machine-ip-address-ddb81df8edf3) to install until step IV with some changes.
**CGI** module will be found in 
`Server Roles > Web Server(IIS) > Web Server > Application Development > CGI`
(If not found at the exact location as given in article)

2. If after all steps â€“ if you get *internal server* error when you access the website url - you can refer these steps: reference [Error an unknown FastCGI error occurred](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6176093/http-error-500-0-internal-server-error-an-unknown-fastcgi-error-occured)

3. To deploy it on port 4000:
- Go to IIS Manager
- In sites dropdown select the TLS checker website
- Select Edit site>Bindings
- Select `https > edit >`
- Enter port 4000
- Add hostname
- You may have to open the port 4000 in inbound firewall rules

- **Deploying using WAMP Server :**

1. This article is very apt but I might go into more details about this installation in coming weeks.
