> A personal collection of insights and lessons I have gained throughout my academic journey.


Hello ! I am *Avani*, a curious ~~Information Technology~~ student with a keen interest in fascinating tech concepts. My plan is to upload all the interesting things I discover here, including my projects, explanations of various concepts, and helpful installation guides. I’m also looking to collaborate on open-source projects, so feel free to connect with me!


I invite you to dive into a vibrant collection of the most intriguing tech projects, ideas, and experiments from the world of software development and beyond. This blog is a sandbox for the ***curious and creative*** — whether you’re a developer seeking inspiration, a tech enthusiast exploring trends, or just someone fascinated by the intersection of code and creativity.

Thank you for visiting my website.
